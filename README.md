## Data Source

This data is provided by the CodeBasis challenge platform and is updated in real-time to reflect current sales performance. The data includes information on revenue, cities, customers, product types, and customer segments.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Understanding and Requirements Gathering
   - Gathered business requirements to identify relevant KPIs and metrics for sales analysis.
   - Defined primary data sources and metrics, such as revenue, product categories, customer types, and regions.

### 2. Data Modeling
   - Designed a star schema to structure the data for efficient querying and analysis.
   - Created fact and dimension tables:
     - **Fact Table**: Sales transactions including metrics like SalesAmount, CustomerID, ProductID, etc.
     - **Dimension Tables**: City, Customer, Product, Date, and CustomerType, each providing contextual information for slicing and dicing the data.

### 3. Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)
   - Extracted sales data from source systems (as provided by CodeBasis).
   - Transformed data to fit the star schema, ensuring data quality and integrity.
   - Loaded the transformed data into the Power BI data model.

### 4. Data Validation and Quality Assurance
   - Implemented validation rules and performed data quality checks to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
   - Conducted cross-checks between raw data and transformed data to verify the data pipeline's accuracy.

### 5. Handling Row Dropping
   - Addressed rows with invalid or erroneous data:
     - For example, rows where `SalesAmount â‰¤ 0` were either corrected or dropped as per business rules.

### 6. Reporting and Analytics
   - Developed a Power BI dashboard to provide insights on the defined KPIs.
   - Utilized various visualizations to create an intuitive and actionable user interface, including bar charts, line charts, and donut charts.
   - Implemented slicers for year, month, and product selection to enable dynamic filtering.

## Insights and Findings

- **Top Customers**: Key customers like "Electricalara Stores" contribute significantly to the overall revenue, with individual breakdowns available for further analysis.
- **Revenue Trend**: Seasonal peaks and troughs are visible in the revenue trend, highlighting periods of increased or decreased sales activity.
- **Product and Customer Segmentation**: The dashboard differentiates between "Own Brand" and "Distribution" products, as well as between "Brick & Mortar" and "E-Commerce" customers, allowing the business to tailor its strategies to each segment.
